# Stroke Visual Rehabilitation (3D Pong With Eye Tracking)

The focus of this project is to apply visual rehabilitation methods for stroke victims with impaired eyesight. The rehab method that is applied slowly trains the patients eyes to look towards their visually impaired side as they follow the ball around the screen. Using Unity, C# Scripts and Tobii's Eye Tracker & SDK, I have recreated the classic arcade game Pong in a re-imagined 3D format. The added twist of the game is to control the paddle using your eyes.
